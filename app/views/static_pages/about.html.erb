    <h3> About Emission Revision </h3>
    <h4 class="mini-spacer">Emission Revision is an environmental impact tracker that allows the user to monitor and track
    their gas emissions, and thus part of their carbon footprint. The app will have the user create an
      account in order for their information to be stored and tracked. The user when refueling will make a fuel log by:
      entering the octane of the gas, the price per litre of gas, the total price paid, and the current mileage
      at fill up. Then as more and more logs are recorded, the carbon emissions are calculated. This is also known as 
      the carbon footprint. This information will be stored in the database. The app also lets users search for other
      users if they have peers or friends who also have an account. By searching, the user can then see their friends
      ecological footprint and compare with each other or strangers. There is also a forum that the user can read or post.
      This forum is public and anyone with an account can use this service for free. In addition, the information
      on fuel consumption can then be used to compare the amount of money one could save if they used public transit rather than drive.
