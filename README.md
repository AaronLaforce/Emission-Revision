Emission Revision is an environmental impact tracker that allows the user to monitor their gas emissions, and thus part of their carbon footprint. Check out a [live version](https://emissionrevision.herokuapp.com) of the app hosted on heroku. The app will have the user create an account in order for their information to be stored and tracked. Once logged in a new car can be added. ![Alt text](/screenshots/screen1.jpg?raw=true "add a new car")
The user when refueling will input the gas price, price paid, and the value of the odometer.

Once two fuel logs have been added your emissions can be checked via the My Fuel Logs page.
