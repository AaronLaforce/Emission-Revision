Emission Revision (working title) is an environmental impact tracker that allows the user to monitor their gas emissions, and thus part of their carbon footprint. The app will have the user create an account in order for their information to be stored and tracked. The user when refueling will input the amount of gas (in litres) they put in, the octane of the gas, and the distance travelled since last refill. This information will be stored server side. The app will calculate the average gas usage per day as well as over the month. All analytics will be stored server side and may be used in the future for things such as scientific research, marketing research, etc. Allows for the user to input the amount of money spent on the gas. This information will then be used to compare the amount of money one could save if they used public transit rather than drive. 

Features include:
Calculating one’s average gas consumption,
Compare gas consumptions with others that live near the user,
Promote eco friendly events and options,
Track public transit usage (potentially connect to compass card).


Pet or Pass is a social media app that uses machine learning to show users pictures of dogs catered to their taste.The user creates an account and enters information regarding their preference of dog (size, colour, breed, etc). The app will present photos of dogs in a similar style to Tinder, where the user swipes right to “pet” the dog, meaning they like that style of dog, and left to pass, meaning the do not like that style of dog. These decisions are passed to the server where it uses a neural net to better determine which dogs to show the user in the future. The app will allow for collaboration with the local animal shelter and will show the user dogs that are up for adoption that are similar to those they have said they liked.

Features include:
Finding local dogs up for adoption,
Donating to local animal shelters,
Talking to others that share similar tastes in dogs,
Paid users can save pictures of dogs they like to an album.
